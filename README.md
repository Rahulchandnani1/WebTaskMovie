# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i` to install all the dependencies
then run below command to start the app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### Steps to interact:
1 This app is made using ReactJs.
2 I am using Omdb Api to display movies with poster image, release year and title.
3 I have also implemented search functionality which dynamically shows list of movies on basis of input like dil,dubai etc.
4 I have also implemented infinite scrolling to update list of movies when user scroll down and move to end of page more list of movies get added.
5 Also implemented the release year range in which user can edit start and end range.
6 When a user hover over movie box a label is shown above it which when clicked, add movie in favourite section and in favourite sections movie box a label to remove it from favourite section is also shown.
7 There is a favourite section at the end of our web app and favourite movie data is stored in local storage.
8 I have also implemented the web accessibility so user with disability can access it.


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
